Hello,

I have uploaded .zip file so you can check once, and let me know if any doubts or issues.

I have followed this https://desiprogrammer.hashnode.dev/customizing-bootstrap-with-and-without-sass link intructions for project setup.

Also i have some vs code setting changed as per this https://github.com/shovoalways/Visual-Studio-Code-Customization/tree/main link intructions.

Here us some tech stack used plugin lists:

1:- Bootstrap
version: "5.3.0"
URL: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

2:- Swiper slider
version: "v9.3.2"
URL: https://swiperjs.com/demos

And i have used SASS as per your requirement


By the way, there was no issue but you sent the XD file but I did not have the XD setup, so there was a little problem, I was not able to export the logo.
after that logo i have exported on photopea. else you can check and let me know

Estimated time to complete your test = My laptop is hanging a bit so it took almost 9 hours to create the page.

Thanks!
